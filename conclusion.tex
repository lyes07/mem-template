The STRM interactive Course is a project that interactively provides the course of STRM to help the students of
 first-year MI, and various people to learn more about STRM, it is an open-source project (free to use).
\paragraph{}
We want this project to simplify the module of STRM and help the new bachelors in this next step in their life
through this project, we faced a lot of problems as freshmen so we don't want new student to face the sime problems especially in one of my favorite modoles which is STRM.
