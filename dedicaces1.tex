First, I would like to dedicate this work to the most important people in my life, to the ones who supported me and guided me diligently throughout this work and throughout my whole life, to my mother and my father. I also dedicate this work to my brother and sisters, and of course to my team, Farouk and Mohammed, with whom I was able to accomplish this work.
