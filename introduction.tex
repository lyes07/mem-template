\paragraph{}
As new students at the university, we noticed the difficulty of adapting to the new system of study and the linguistic discrepancy, in addition to the difficulty of communicating and interacting directly with professors.

\paragraph{}
In the machine structure lessons, we noticed the possibility of developing and embodying its lessons into applications that contain interactive lessons and examples in order to help students gain a deeper understanding of the lessons.

Computer architecture is a science or a set of rules stating how computer software and hardware are joined together and interact to make a computer work. It not only deter-mines how the computer works but also of which technologies the computer is capable.\cite{Computer-Architecture-saylor-academy}

In our case and as distant as our search goes there are no as of now existing solutions(neither apps nor websites), but there exists a few tools, websites and mobile apps that are to some degree related to our extend.

\paragraph{}
Our manuscript is structured in three chapters:\\\\
First, chapter will talk about the general dedefinitions of computer architecture, role, and problem in distributing them, and we will mention examples of the existing applications.
\\Second chapter, In this chapter we will present the conceptual solution for our application, and introduce a detailed demo of our app to explain its basic functions and structure. But before that, we will present Modelling tool used: UML.
\\Third chapter, we will talk about the environment (Work and Software) and about the will use programming languages and presentation of graphical interfaces.
