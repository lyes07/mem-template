I dedicate our work to my family and many friends. A special feeling of gratitude to my loving parents whose words of encouragement and push for tenacity ring in my ears. My Brothers SIDALI and ABD EL MONEIM have never left my side and were very special.

I will always appreciate all they have done, especially AZZEDINE MOULAI for helping me develop my skills, NOUREDDINE and HITHEM for the many hours of study adventures, and IMAD KHIDER and OUSSAMA for sharing an amazing academic years.
