My dedications go particularly to my dear parents, as well as my family, 
And everyone who helped me to reach this level of success achieved, 
Docent Professor Taha Zerrouki our guide in this Pleasant work, and my Duo 
Ilyes Grine and Farouk Lamri, also every Colleague involved directly or indirectly. 
Not to forget everyone who encouraged me to go all the way long 
Along with a lot of respect to every employee at the University of AMO.
